## Questions

Why do surgery charges consistently dominate other revenue categories on the dashboard?
What underlying causes lead to monthly spikes in medicine sales and patient discharges?
Are there age or demographic factors influencing satisfaction scores and patient outcomes?
How do staff numbers affect patient throughput and satisfaction in different departments?
Is medicine stock depletion correlated with patient admission peaks or particular illness outbreaks?
What improvements can be implemented for departments or doctor specialties with lower patient ratings?
Are available beds and room types adequately matched to patient demand throughout the year?
How effective are doctor follow-up appointments in improving discharge rates and test outcomes?
Do certain payment methods correlate with higher billed amounts or service utilization?
Are there gaps in diagnostic coverage or patient care visibility for test results still marked as "Blank" or incomplete?

## Summary of Findings

There is a consistent trend in patient discharges across months, with some seasonal variations.
Surgery charges remain the highest revenue source compared to other hospital services.
Most patients fall within the 31 to 60 age range, indicating key demographics for hospital services.
Patient satisfaction appears high, with frequent ratings of 4 and 5 stars.
Doctor appointments and surgeries are distributed evenly throughout the week and month.
Stock and sale quantities of medicines are closely tracked, enabling efficient inventory management.
ICU and private rooms often have higher occupancy rates compared to general rooms.
Total medicine sales spike during certain months, possibly due to outbreaks or seasonal factors.
Staff count and doctor count remain relatively stable over the dashboard period.
Most patient test results returned as "Normal," suggesting good routine patient health or effective treatments.
